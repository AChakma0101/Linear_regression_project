### Project Title
**Building and Evaluating a Linear Regression Model**

### Description
This project entails EDA (exploratory data analysis) of the Boston housing dataset, building a _supervised learning_ linear regression model with the objective of predicting median home price (MEDV) - the target in this scenario - using some features provided. The sample dataset provides median values of homes in different areas around Boston. Along with the median home values in $1000 (MEDV), crime (CRIM), nitric oxides concentration (NOX), the average number of rooms (RM), percentage of lower status of the population (LSTAT), and other features are also provided. There is necessary `code` to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing as wells as visualizing _descriptive statistics_.

Details of Boston house prices dataset is available [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#boston-dataset).

### Files used
* The Boston housing dataset is built into scikit-learn.
